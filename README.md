### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Nwafor Livinus Anayo, an Engineer very passionate about 2 things:

- Building Things which solve human problems
- Teaching and mentoring others on how to do the same

I will love to combine my passion for bulding things, solving problem, learning and teaching with my engineering skills either as software engineer or hardware engineer to solve problems that impact a huge number of people positively, to be a motivation and encouragement to others to do the same, and to possibly mentor people who are starting out.
