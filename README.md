### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Nwafor Livinus Anayo, an Engineer very passionate about 2 things:

- Building Things that solve human problems
- Teaching and mentoring others on how to do the same

I will love to combine my passion for building things, solving problems, learning, and teaching with my engineering skills either as a software engineer or hardware engineer to solve problems that impact a vast number of people positively, to be a motivation and encouragement to others to do the same and to mentor people who are starting out possibly.
